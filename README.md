# Legacy Mailer and Push Notifications

## Project
A centralized node for legacy banking that will handle push notifications for cellular and web devices connected to our infrastructure. 

## Purpose
Working with cloud infrastructure and node.js to create robust centralized messaging endpoints. 

## Source code used
- Javascript (es6+)
- Node.JS framework

## Database used
- Non-relational Database: MongoDB

## Cloud Infrastructure
- MongoDB Atlas: MongoDB database hosting
- Amazon EC2 service: Use to host this source in the cloud in combination with Dockerization.

# End Goal
- Host centralized messaging in the cloud, along with the database. This will allow for horizontal scaling when pressed with increased user interactions by having the nodes dockerized and conected via Docker Swarm.
